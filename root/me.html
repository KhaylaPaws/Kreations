<h2>Affection ideas:</h2>
being held—arms around waist, lap sits, or back hugs while busy

hand-holding, thighs touching, legs tangled, constant little touches

leaning into hugs, weighty cuddles

being stroked or played with: hair ruffled, ears rubbed, back scratches

smelling plushies or clothes with your scent

Light tickles under chin or on neck make melt/squeak

being carried or moved—lifted, tugged, scooted into you

melt from warm breath on your skin—neck, ear, collarbone especially

Falling asleep your arms every night, like it's just normal

Being the “little spoon” every night, no matter what

Hearing you proudly call you theirs in front of people

Curling into someone’s lap while watching something, not even caring what it is

you wrap around me protectively

Feeling adored even when doing nothing at all—just existing, and being wanted

face in your shirt or chest and just staying there

Feeling hand(s) slide in hands or onto body

Being cuddled, cradled, carried, or pinned

Hair stroking, back rubs, gentle forehead kisses

Holding hands in public

Being squeezed tight or held from behind

Wanting to always be near, even if just sitting together quietly

Watching movies just to be cuddled up

excited about shared rituals (game night, meal time, bedtime)

Constant cuddling, hand-holding, clinging, or lap-sitting

Gentle touches—stroking hair, brushing shoulders, tracing fingers

<p>bully, bullied, abuse, anger issues, dysphoria and euphoria</p>
